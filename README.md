## Introduction
This project explores restaurant consumer preferences and ratings across Mexico. 
Using survey and rating data, the dashboard uncovers insights into consumer demographics, cuisine preferences, alcohol consumption habits, 
and restaurant performance. The goal is to identify factors influencing restaurant ratings and guide decision-making for restaurant owners and policymakers.

## Methodology
- Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Power BI Transformation
- DAX measures
- Data Visualization

## Key Metrics/ Questions 
- Question 1.  
What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on 
ratings? 

- Question 2.  
What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample? 

- Question 3.  
Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market? 

- Question 4.  
If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?

Analysis

- Q1. What can you learn from the highest-rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences affect ratings?
  
The average restaurant rating is 1.20 across all restaurants, showing very little variation.

This means consumer preferences are not strongly reflected in ratings. Instead, demand is better seen in cuisine choices.

Mexican cuisine is by far the most preferred, followed by American and Cafeteria-style.

Insight: Ratings alone are not reliable for decision-making. Preference trends are a stronger indicator of opportunity.


- Q2. What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate bias in the sample?
  
Young Adults dominate the consumer base (majority of respondents), followed by a smaller share of mature and adult groups.

Budget preferences show medium-budget consumers are the largest group, with fewer high-budget customers.

Drinking level: Social drinkers and abstainers are more represented than casual drinkers.

Marital status and smoker status were captured but show no extreme skew.

Bias: The dataset overrepresents young adults and medium-budget consumers. Insights may not fully reflect older or high-income groups.


- Q3. Are there any demand & supply gaps to exploit?
  
Mexican cuisine shows the largest demandâ€“supply gap: consumer preference is much higher than the number of restaurants offering it.

Other cuisines (Cafeteria, Fast Food, Brewery) are oversupplied relative to demand.

Opportunity: Investing in Mexican restaurants would capture unmet demand.


- Q4. If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?
  
Based on consumer demand, demographics, and spending patterns:

Cuisine: Mexican (highest demand, undersupplied).

Target Group: Young Adults (largest share).

Budget: Medium-budget offering (most popular).

Drinking Preference: Social drinkers (strongly represented).

Location: States like San Luis and Morelos with larger consumer shares should be prioritized.

## Recommended investment:

A medium-budget Mexican restaurant in San Luis, targeting young adult social drinkers.
